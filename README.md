# emotion-detection-and-reaction

Repository for Hot Topic Seminar Camera-based Multimodal Emotion Detection


## Objective 🎯

The objective of this project is to train and deploy a microservice that detects the current emotion of a user based on his voice and facial expression from his webcam and microphone inputs.

## Methodology 🃏

Two separate models (audio and video) predict the emotion in parallel. The final class prediction is a weighted and combined "multimodal" prediction of the two seperate predictions.

		| Emotion  | Number of Audiofiles |
		| ------------- | ------------- |
		| Angry  | 652  |
		| Fear  | 652  |
		| Happy  | 652  |
		| Sad  | 652  |
		
 	- feature sets: Zero Crossing Rate, Chroma, MFCC, Root Mean Square Value, MelSpectrogram
 	- improved by augmentation techniques: added noise, streched, shifted and pitched audio files (see jupyter training files for more details)
	
- Video: 📽️
	- dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravsharma99/ck48-5-emotions">CK+48 5 emotions<a> (used 4 of them)
	
		| Emotion  | Number of Images |

	- Librosa

## Requirements and installation instructions / Tutorial

 - a <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python installation<a> is necessary (at least V3.7)
 - a working webcam and microphone is necessary. The input ports should be detected automatically.
 - git clone the repo
 - install the dependencies from requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)
 - run the app.py file and wait until the server is started and ready. This can take up to 2 minutes
 - open localhost <a href="https://127.0.0.1:5000/">127.0.0.1:5000/<a> on your favorite web browser
 - the usage of the application is self-explanatory
 
 ## Features
 
 - both models can be used standalone or together
	
 - Audio:🎧
	- analyzing audio
	- displaying probability of each emotion as a real-time updating bar chart
 - Video: 📽️
	- analyzing video and face
	- displaying probability of each emotion as a real-time updating bar chart
 - Multimodal: 🎧📽️
	- analyzing audio and video
	- displaying video and audio probability of each emotion as a real-time updating bubble chart (no multimodality yet!)
	- combined value (70-30)
	- reaction to human by displaying emoji of predicted emotion (multimodality used!)
	
## Results 🎯

 - Accuracy on test data Video: 99%
 - Accuracy on test data Audio: 91%
 - these accuracies are really high, but in reality, when used in a productive environment they (mainly the audio model) struggle to precisely predict emotions.
	
 
 ## open points 📄
 
 - improve accuracy on unknown voices
 - analyse over a bigger time span to increase accuracy
 - improve datasets with more natural/diverse situations
 - improve server performance: change framework and architecture
 - change to multistep recognition: recognize user first and select suitable model, include text and gestures


 ## FAQ 💡
 
 - if video recognition doesn't work: make sure the camera is not blocked by some other application (e.g. Videocalling in Zoom or Teams).
 - if the microphone doesn't work: uncomment lines 101-105 in audio_recognizer.py and check the correct index of your microphone. Adjust in line 95 (dev_index)
 - only access the server once, it will crash otherwise. Pyaudio can only handle one request at a time.
